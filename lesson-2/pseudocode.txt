1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

declare fx with parameter n1 and n2
  return n1 + n2

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a 
   string that is all those strings concatenated together

declare fx with param array
  iterate through array
  concatenate each element onto new string
  return new string

START

# given array of strings

SET empty string variable

WHILE arr.length > 0
  concatenate string to empty string

RETURN new string

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns 
  a new array with every other element from 
  the original array, starting with the first element. 

SET empty array

iterate through array
  push even index element from input array into empty array

RETURN array

4. a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of 
  a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character 
  is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex' the method should
  return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character
  does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.

START

input => str, char
SET empty hash

WHILE i < str.length
  iterate through str and push char: index into hash
  IF hash.count >= 3
    RETURN last value of hash
  ELSE
    RETURN nil

END

5. a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the 
  result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array
  should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned
  array, while the elements of the second array should become the 
  elements at the odd indexes.
  # both arr args have the same number of elements

START
input => arr1, arr2

SET e_arr

WHILE i < arr1.length
  e_arr.push(arr1[i])
  e_arr.push(arr2[i])

RETURN e_arr
